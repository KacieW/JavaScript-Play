##Point to AngularJS app: ng-app
We tell what part of the HTML contains the AngularJS app. 
  This done by adding the "ng-app" attribute to the "ROOT" HTML element of the AngularJS app.

##View: ng-controller
ng-controller tells AngularJS what controller to use with this view. 
The controller function is registered in angular via the **angular.module(...).controller(...)** function call.
